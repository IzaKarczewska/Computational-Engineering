## Monte Carlo Algorithm

This project contains estimating the value of π (pi) using Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo algorithm is a classic probabilistic method that uses random sampling to approximate mathematical quantities.

### Function Descriptions

1. Generate random points within a square with side length 'r'.
2. Determines whether each point is inside or outside the circle.
3. Estimates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method.
4. Visualizes the generated points and the quarter circle.

### Vizualization

In addition to the above functions, the Jupyter notebook also includes various generated visualizations. This help in understanding the behavior of the estimation of π as the number of random points increases.

#### 1. Temporary Estimated Value of π vs. Number of Random Points

A plot showing the temporary estimated value of π as the number of random points increases.

#### 2. Mean Squared Error in Estimation of π vs. Number of Points

A plot showing the mean squared error in the estimation of π as the number of points increases.

#### 3. Boxplot of π Estimation of π vs. Number of Points

A boxplot showing the distribution of π estimates after 50 series for different numbers of points.
